    "The code below generates a data frame of the highest recorded temperatures in London for the week 19-25 August according to https://www.timeanddate.com/weather/uk/london/historic. However, the columns are mixed up with the rows. Rectify this so that the values in the first column (not the index column) are the column names and items further along the row are under that column. Note that ````$^\\circ C$```` is just LaTeX that gives the units for temperature as a mathmatical symbol so don't just treat this as part of the string. Hint: think about the type of input this function takes and how these get converted to data frames."

This is perfectly fine as you can input a negative number for a slice as Python will simply work from the last value working back to the first as you increase a negative slice ie ````x[-1]```` returns the last array value, ````x[-2]```` returns the second to last array value and so forth. Hint: Think of how data frames are sliced and do any of the functions below appear to be missing arguments? You may also have to rerun the previous code cell to ensure the data frame doesn't change too much while you've been changing the code below to the correct form."
