    "### Pandas Series\n",
    "Pandas series are similar to Numpy arrays however the key difference is that we can specify an index for a Pandas series. In most other respects such as when applying numerical operations series behave much like arrays. To generate a series one needs to pass ````pd.Series(x)```` where ````x```` is a list to be converted to a series. One can also pass the argument ````index=y````where ````y```` is a list of the indexes we wish to use for the respective series values. Below are two code cells, the first of which passes no ````index```` argument. This means by default the indexes will be as you expect of a list and Python array ie integers starting from $0$. The second code cell creates a series but passes another list for the ````index```` argument."

    "The function ````pd.read_csv()```` assumes by default that your variables are seperated with commas. This is not always the case however. In such cases you'll require a delimiter argument and also potentially an engine argument. The delimiter argument specifies the seperation between columns. By default this is set to a comma. However, the file to be read below contains columns seperated by three spaces. We pass the argument ````delimiter=\"   \"```` to account for the way in which the columns are seperated. This leads to another problem and that is that Pandas is not written entirely in Python. Pandas also makes use of the C engine which doesn't recognise seperators greater than one character. This is fixed by specifying ````engine=\"python\"```` so that Python reads the seperator instead."

    "#### df.fillna\n",
    "When we used ````df.dropna()```` above all rows with NaN data were removed. This can be a problem because we are losing information from the other columns that don't have NaN data. A way of dealing with this is to use ````df.fillna(x)```` instead. Here, instead of removing rows we replace any NaN with whatever ````x```` is. Typically this would be chosen to be some extreme value that would be recognised by an algorithm as an outlier. Again the argument ````inplace=True```` can be used to redefine the data frame."

We often pass an additional argument ````index=False````. This removes the index column when converting to the file. Often this column will be unesserary and meaningless, only serving to take up space. When reading the file an index column is typically generated anyway so storing the index column isn't necessary."
